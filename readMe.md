I should probably add a how to here:
    this uses node.js, so you'll need that, maybe run an npm init?  I'm not sure, quite new to all this.
    I'd get it running with "node server.js" (sans quotes) in the terminal, then ctrl click the console logged link to open it, or manually go to the specified http://localhost:3000.
    hit refresh to generate a new random quote.
    thats about all there is.

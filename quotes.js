    "It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased.",
    "We all want progress, but if you're on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.",
    "Your faith will not fail while God sustains it; you are not strong enough to fall away while God is resolved to hold you.",
    "God uses chronic pain and weakness, along with other afflictions, as his chisel for sculpting our lives. Felt weakness deepens dependence on Christ for strength each day. The weaker we feel, the harder we lean. And the harder we lean, the stronger we grow spiritually, even while our bodies waste away. To live with your \'thorn\' uncomplainingly - that is, sweet, patient, and free in heart to love and help others, even though every day you feel weak - is true sanctification. It is true healing for the spirit. It is a supreme victory of grace.",
    "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.  And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.",
    " For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin. 16 Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.",
    "Fasting: abstaining from (fill in the blank) to increase your hunger for the things of God.",
    "When you ask god \"who am I?\", don\'t be surprised when he responds with \"I am\"",
    "Chose to sin, chose to suffer",
    "Faith is believing in the word of God and acting upon it, no matter how I feel, because God promises a good result",
    "Blessing follows obedience",
    "When Satan reminds you of your past, remind him of his future.",
    "\"Miracle is, from the point of view of the scientist, a form of doctoring, tampering, (if you like) cheating.  It introduces a new factor into the situation, namely supernatural force, which the scientist had not reckoned on.  He calculates what will happen r what must have happened on a past occasion, in the belief that the situation, at that point of space and time, is or was A.  But if supernatural force has been added, then the situation really is or was AB.  And no one knows better than the scientist that AB cannot yield the same result as A.  The necessary truth of the laws, far from making it impossible that miracles should occur makes it certain that if the Supernatural is operating they must occur.  For if the natural situation by itself, and the natural situation plus something else, yielded the same result, it would be then that we should be faced with a lawless and unsystematic universe.  The better you know that tow and two make four, the better you know that two and three don\'t.\"",
    "\"Humility isn\'t thinking less of yourself, it\'s thinking of yourself less\"",
    "\"We have no business preaching grace to people who do un understand the implications of God's law.  It is meaningless to expound grace to someone who does not know the divine demand for righteousness.  Those who do not even sense their own guilt cannot possibly comprehend God's mercy.  You cannot preach a gospel of peace to someone who has not heard that God requires obedience and punished disobedience.\"",
    "The law is for the self-righteous, to humble their pride. The gospel is for the lost, to remove their despair",
    "Acts of kindness apart from the gospel only make people more comfortable on their way to hell",
    "We shouldn't be waiting for voices when we already have verses"
